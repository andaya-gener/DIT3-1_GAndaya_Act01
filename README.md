# MY SHORT REFLECTION ABOUT THE LESSONS

Installing Android Studio was not an easy process for me because it took a long time and required downloading many additional components after the installer. Despite the challenge, it taught me the importance of patience and preparation when setting up a development environment.

From learning about the Android app structure, I discovered how mobile operating systems work as the foundation that manages hardware, apps, and user interactions. I also learned that Android architecture includes layers like the Linux Kernel, Libraries, Application Framework, and Application Layer, which provide flexibility and customization. This helped me appreciate how apps are built to balance performance, security, and user experience.
